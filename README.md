# Nano-Paste
A replica of PasteBIN that is deployable on a local network

The Idea is simple, have a place where you can paste data to, and get a url returned where people can read said data.

* I want to develop this in C# .net Core ~6~ 5 so it can be deployed to both linux and windows.
* I want to first make the back end API
* Then make a simple bootstrap interface
* Then I would like to try Angular JS and see how it will appear
* I want to support mysql/mariadb, and MicrosoftSQL
More to come as I think of it
